                Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah <br>
                La, la, la, la <br><br>
                Girl, you don't know, nah <br>
                What you do to me <br>
                When I see that crinkle on your nose <br>
                I wonder if you fluently just <br>
                Do you <br>
                Like you do so effortlessly <br>
                I want you right next to me <br>
                I want you to be my <br>
                Be my, my <br><br>
                Green Tea in the morning <br>
                Be my, my sugar honey <br>
                You're just so great <br>
                I wonder, girl <br>
                I wonder why you love me <br>
                It's so lovely, can't complain <br>
                One day, I'll give you my name <br>
                If you're down <br>
                If you're down <br><br>
                Be my Green Tea in the morning <br>
                Be my, my sugar honey <br>
                You're just so great <br>
                I wonder, girl <br>

                One day I'll give you my name <br>
                If you're down <br>
                If you're down <br><br>
                I can't describe the feeling you gave <br>
                When you blew me away and I <br>
                Carry that every day <br>
                My sunshine and my moon (you're my moon) <br>
                You're all I wanna do (all I wanna do) <br>
                Every night until we're through <br>
                These little moments that we've got (that we've got) <br>
                You make me feel like something I'm not <br>
                Green Tea and Honey, babe <br>
                So warm and sweet <br>
                You're all I need <br>
                Just you and me <br><br>
                I said now here we go again <br>
                Another verse about how you got me feeling it <br>
                I'm feeling very many different types of ways <br>
                I just gotta say <br>
                I just wanna see you every second of every day <br>
                If that's ok then let me know <br>
                Yes, I got a flow <br>
                That can make us go afloat <br>
                Thirty thousand we won't ever hear below <br>
                You're a queen and the world is yours to hold, yeah <br><br>
                Baby, I got you <br>
                And, baby, you got me <br>
                Tell me how you feelin' <br>
                Just keep it real and promise we'll find peace <br>
                Your smile, it got me <br>
                Got me lost like your eyes <br>
                Baby, I just want you <br>
                Want you to go in <br>
                Want you to be my <br><br>
                Green Tea in the morning <br>
                Be my, my sugar honey <br>
                You're just so great <br>
                I wonder, girl <br>
                I wonder why you love me <br>
                It's so lovely, can't complain <br>
                One day I'll give you my name <br>
