                There's no way to time it <br>
                And where you may find it is unknown <br>

                You see it, believe it now <br><br>
                Search the definition of shame <br>

                Who's gonna save me now? <br>
                I hope it's you, my babe <br><br>
                Don't change a thing, you are amazing <br>
