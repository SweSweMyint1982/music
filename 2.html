                Goin' out tonight, changes into something red <br>
                Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress <br>
                Everything she never had she's showin' off <br>
                Drivin' too fast, moon is breakin' through her hair <br>
                She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget <br>
                Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants <br><br>
                We're only gettin' older, baby <br>
                And I've been thinkin' about it lately <br>
                Does it ever drive you crazy <br>
                Just how fast the night changes? <br>
                Everything that you've ever dreamed of <br>
                Disappearing when you wake up <br>
                But there's nothing to be afraid of <br>
                Even when the night changes <br>
                It will never change me and you <br><br>
                Chasing it tonight, doubts are runnin' 'round her head <br>
                He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette <br>
                Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop <br>
                Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin <br>
                She's fallin', doesn't even know it yet <br>
                Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants <br><br>
                We're only gettin' older, baby <br>
                And I've been thinkin' about it lately <br>
                Does it ever drive you crazy <br>
                Just how fast the night changes? <br>
                Everything that you've ever dreamed of  <br>
                Disappearing when you wake up <br>
                But there's nothing to be afraid of <br>
                Even when the night changes <br><br>
                It will never change me and you <br>
                Goin' out tonight, changes into something red <br>
                Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress <br>
                Reminds her of the missin' piece of innocence she lost <br><br>
                We're only gettin' older, baby <br>
                And I've been thinkin' about it lately <br>

                It will never change me and you</p></font>
